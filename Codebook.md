Honestly speaking I am not sure what extra info should be added other than what is already that comes with the data. Except the feature names should now be the mean of the variables and there will be features for the categorical variables, namely activity label and subject. I do not know if we need to change this, instructions were not much clear.


The features are explained in the features_info.text as well as features.txt.

Each row represents one observation and the data is grouped per activity label per observation. Each row represents the mean data for each column ( representing mean and/or std ) in the original data, for one subject, for one activity label.

The first two columns represent activity level and subject # respectively.
